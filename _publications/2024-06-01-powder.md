**Abstract**

Modern distributed systems rely on consensus protocols to build a fault-tolerant-core upon which they can build applications. Consensus protocols are correct under a specific failure model, where up to $f$ machines can fail. We argue that this $f$-threshold failure model oversimplifies the real world and limits potential opportunities to optimize for cost or performance. We argue instead for a probabilistic failure model that captures the complex and nuanced nature of faults observed in practice. Probabilistic consensus protocols can explicitly leverage individual machine failure curves and explore side-stepping traditional bottlenecks such as majority quorum intersection, enabling systems that are more reliable, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable.
