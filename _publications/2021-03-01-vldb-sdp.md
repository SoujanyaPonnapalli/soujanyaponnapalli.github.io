**Abstract**

This paper presents our novel approach "Software-Defined Data Protection" (SDP). Its simple, yet powerful premise is to decouple often changing policies from request-level enforcement to allow distributed smart storage nodes to implement the latter at line-rate. Existing and future data protection frameworks can be translated to the same hardware interface which allows storage nodes to offload enforcement efficiently both for company-specific rules and regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA.
